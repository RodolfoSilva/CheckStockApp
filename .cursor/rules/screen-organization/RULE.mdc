# Screen and Component Organization Rules

## Screen Organization
- All screen components must be placed in `src/screens/[module-name]/[name]-screen.tsx`
  - Module folder names must use kebab-case (e.g., `conferences`, `assets`, `places`)
  - Screen file names must use kebab-case and end with `-screen.tsx` (e.g., `conferences-screen.tsx`, `assets-screen.tsx`)
  - Screen component names should use PascalCase (e.g., `ConferencesScreen`, `AssetsScreen`)

## Component Organization
- Screen-specific components must be placed in `src/screens/[module-name]/components/`
  - The `components` folder name must be lowercase and plural
  - Component file names must use kebab-case (e.g., `asset-card.tsx`, `place-card.tsx`, `search-bar.tsx`)
  - Component names should use PascalCase (e.g., `AssetCard`, `PlaceCard`, `SearchBar`)

## Expo Router Pages
- Pages in `src/app/(tabs)/` and other route directories should be thin wrappers that import and render the corresponding screen from `src/screens/`
- Route files should only handle navigation concerns and delegate rendering to screen components

## Examples
- Screen: `src/screens/conferences/conferences-screen.tsx` exports `ConferencesScreen`
- Screen components: `src/screens/conferences/components/conference-card.tsx` exports `ConferenceCard`
- Route: `src/app/(tabs)/conferences.tsx` imports and renders `ConferencesScreen`

## Naming Conventions
- **Folders**: Always use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Screen files**: Always use kebab-case ending with `-screen.tsx`
- **Component files**: Always use kebab-case
- **Component/Class names**: Always use PascalCase
- **Module folders**: Use kebab-case matching the feature domain (e.g., `conferences`, `assets`, `places`)
